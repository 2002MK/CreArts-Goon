## Prerequisites

1. git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. node and npm (v10.0.0 or higher) - https://nodejs.org

Discord Canary (Powercord will only work with Canary!)
1. Windows: https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=win
2. Linux (deb): https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=linux
3. Linux (tar.gz): https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=linux&format=tar.gz
4. macOS: https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=osx

## Instalation

1. Please ensure that you’ve installed ‘Git’ and ‘Node’ and are using ‘Discord Canary’ before proceeding through these steps. It is required, if you are on Linux, to have Discord Canary running while installing Powercord.

2. Open a command prompt / terminal of your choice (e.g. CMD if you’re on Windows, or Terminal if you’re using Linux/macOS). Do not open your terminal as an administrator! Powercord will fail injecting if you do so.
3. In chronological order, type each of these commands using the command prompt / terminal opened in Step 1:

  - `git clone https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord`
  - `cd powercord`
  - `npm i`
  - `npm run plug` (Linux users: you'll need to run this command with sudo)

4. Completely kill your Discord Client (right-click Discord in the System Tray -> “Quit DiscordCanary”)
Start Discord back up and Powercord should be injected!
